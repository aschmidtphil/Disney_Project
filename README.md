# Disney Data Insights 

I hear you want to put your skills to the test.

The goal is to create functions that even a casual user can utilize.
Ultimately your analysis will help decide the direction and future investments the company will make.

The use of Descriptive Statistics will enable you to identify trends and patterns and ultimately answer the core questions that your boss might have.


In this project, you will repeat and deepen the following topics from your training so far::

- Strings
- Descriptive Statistics
- Build Re-usable Functions
